Item Assumptions:
1. If duplicate items present in inventory, use the ones that appear first.
2. Bombs are placed on same position as player, just one layer up.
3. Swords and Bows can be used in combination ie. if both are present in the inventory, character attacks twice with higher attack.
4. Duplicate weapons cannot be stacked. For example, if character has multiple swords, dmg bonus applies only once, and uses
   durability of one sword.
