Item Assumptions:
1. If duplicate items present in inventory, use the ones that appear first.
2. Bombs are placed on same position as player on the same layer.
3. Swords and Bows can be used in combination ie. if both are present in the inventory, character attacks twice with higher attack.
4. Duplicate weapons cannot be stacked. For example, if character has multiple swords, dmg bonus applies only once, and uses
   durability of one sword.
5. Using an item decreases its durability by 1.
6. Potions have a 'duration' of multiple ticks, and invincibility does not end after one battle.

Observer Assumptions:
1. The player moves before enemies at each tick.
2. The player and enemy takes damage at the same time in battles.
3. The player takes no damage from battles when in the invincible state.
